I am currently a solutions architect with [Amtrak Tech. Pvt. Ltd.](http://amtraktech.com/). I am also a partner solution architect with NVIDIA Graphics Pvt. Ltd. I work with customers, mainly to solve their deep learning hassles, and help them optimize their workflows with the help of tools providied by NVIDIA, viz. TensorRT, AMP etc. When I am not working with customers, I enjoy researching in the field of deep hebbian learning and finding better methods of solving the learning to learn problem.

I have graduated in 2019, majoring in Mechanical engineering from BMS College of Engineering. During my undergrad I have been a versatile student working with various clubs in college namely the Machine Learning club(ML@BMS), Bullz Racing(Racing team of BMS), RESPAWN(Gaming Club of BMSCE), MUNSOC(MUN Society), Rotaract Club of BMSCE and have also served as the Coordinator for the Mechanical Engineering Association(MEA) of BMSCE and have organized the techno-cultural fest called Dynamech as a part of MEA.

I have also represented my college chess team during my period in BMS competing in district level and state level competitions. Apart from playing for college I am a gamer who enjoys playing Counter Strike: Global Offensive for the college gaming team as a In-Game Lead(IGL).
